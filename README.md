# IP Address Tracker

![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/dwberri?style=social)

Find out where an IP address is from! I found this idea at Frontend Mentor as a [challege](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0) and decided it would be a quick project to get up and running.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Using the application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
